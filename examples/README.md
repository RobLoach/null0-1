This folder contains native examples in plain C.

You can use them to test the API, and if you wanted, you could use a similar API to what you would find in carts to create a standalone native game, although I would recommend making a C cart instead, since it's more cross-platform, and simpler.

They use pntr_app's `main` wrapper.

I use it to test the API before the WAMR host is setup.
